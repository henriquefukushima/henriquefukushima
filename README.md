# 👋 Hey there! I'm Henrique

## 🧠 About 

Welcome! I'm an undergraduate student in Molecular Sciences at the University of São Paulo (CCM-USP), passionate about learning and understanding the world through multiple lenses — be it science, data, sports or music. My main focus lies in **data science and machine learning**, especially when applied to **financial modeling** and **scientific research**. I’m driven by the belief that meaningful insights often emerge when you connect ideas across disciplines.

Before diving into tech, I spent years competing as a **high-performance tennis athlete**, earning national and international titles. That journey taught me discipline, strategic thinking, and resilience — all of which now guide how I approach research, code, and problem-solving.

This GitHub is a space where I share my experiments, projects, and the things I’m building as I grow into a multidisciplinary thinker and developer.
